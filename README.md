This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Next.js

A React framework for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.

- Framework for creating pre-rendered websites
- Offers us both server side rendering(SSR) and static site generation(SSG)
- SSR: When React components are rendered into HTML pages on the server, when a page request comes from the browser
- SSG: When React components are rendered into HTML pages at the built time, so that we can deploy the webpages and JS bundles them
- SO Next.js creates pre-rendered React components before sending them to the browser. The benefits:

1. Pre-rendering improves performance
1. Better SEO(search engine optimization)

- Without Next, React renders components in the browser, called Client side rendering.

### Installation

`npx create-next-app next-list`

### Folders/files inside Next App

1. pages: Here all different pages components will be created. Every page in Next has its own React component.So, for about page we will have an about component,for contact page we ll have a contact component, etc.
1. api: for all api end points
1. public: for images,etc
1. styles: for CSS files
1. `_app.js`: This file, inside `pages` folder, runs all our pages. It renders `<Component {...pageProps}>`

### run it locally

`npm run dev`

- And you will be shown `url : http://localhost:3000`
- Copy this url and paste it in browser and you will see your Next App running.

### pages folder

- So, if I create a file say, contact.js inside `pages` folder, Next will automatically create a route `/about` and link that route with this file. The file name and location of each page component is tied to the route of that particular page. The only exception to this is `index.js` file inside `pages` folder, as Next create a special route `/` (and not `/index`) for `index.js` file.
- Let's create a file `about.js` inside `pages` folder

```js
const About = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1> About</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am Sid</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default About;
```

- Now, if we go to our running app and add `/about` after `localhost:3000`, we see a new page which shows the content of out `about.js` file.
- We can also create sub folders, say `yahoo` inside `pages` folder and create page components inside that sub folder say `test123.js`. So, now Next will create a route for this page as `/yahoo/test123`. So, thw route depends on the sub folder name and also the file name inside that sub folder.
- Say, we create another page inside the `yahoo` subfolder, say `index.js`, so now Next will create a route for this as `/yahoo`. Always remember for a file name `index.js`, Next will always create a root route ONLY
- So, we can create a multi page website with Next very easily

### Dropping components

- These are not page components, which we can reuse in different page components. Examples are Navbar comp, contact form comp. We DO NOT store these dropping components inside `pages` folder. We store them in a different folder, created in root, say `comps` or `components`. Let's create a folder `components` and inside it create a file called `Navbar.js`. Then we go to `index.js` and import it there.

### Linking Pages

- Client-side transitions between routes can be enabled via the Link component exported by `next/link`.
- Let's go to `Navbar` component and at top write:

```js
import Link from "next/link";
```

- Then, surround the anchor tags with this `link` component and include `href` prop/attribute to it. Like this:

```js
<Link href="/">
  <a>Home</a>
</Link>
```

### Code Splitting

- Code-splitting is the process of splitting the applicationâ€™s bundle into smaller chunks required by each entry point. The goal is to improve the application's initial load time by only loading the code required to run that page.
- Next.js has built-in support for code splitting. Each file inside your pages/ directory will be automatically code split into its own JavaScript bundle during the build step.
- So, ONLY the code that is needed for a page is served from the server. When we go to some other page for the 1st time, say be clicking a button, ONLY then the code needed to serve that particular page will be server by the server. AFter that if we go back to that page after some time, server will not server that page again because we already have it.
- Any <Link /> that is in the viewport (initially or through scroll) will be preloaded. Prefetching is only enabled in production. Prefetch the page in the background. Defaults to true.SO, that makes a very quick user experience.

### Creating a layout component

- Let's create a layout component that contains a Header and a Footer component. Then this LAyout component wraps all our pages. Create `Layout` component and write:

```js
import Navbar from "./Navbar";
import Footer from "./Footer";

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="content">
      <Navbar />
      {/* Here children refers to <Component {...pageProps}>, ie all our pages */}
      {children}
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Layout;
```

- Go to `_app.js` file and write:

```js
import "../styles/globals.css";
// Components
import Layout from "../components/Layout";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

- Delete `<Navbar />` and `<Footer />` from `index.js`. So, now whenever we create a new page, that page always has a Navbar at top and a Footer at bottom.

### CSS

- `global.css` inside `styles` folder (created by default by Next): Any CSS we write inside `global.css` file, is applied to anything on the whole App
- in `_app.js`, we have `import "../styles/globals.css";`, which means every component/pages that are rendered by `_app.js` will have these styles.
- For component/page specific styles, we use `Home.module.css` (created by default by Next). We create component specific CSS in this module and then import it in that component/page. After that where we want to apply these CSS, we use `className = {styles.nameOfClass}`. If we now go to developer tools and then go to Elements and inspect this class, we will see a random set of characters/numbers after this class name. For example : `.Home_description__41Owk`. This way we don't have to worry about class names(or name clashes) for our CSS as Next will take care of it.So, Next will scope this CSS to that page only.If we use the same class name in some other page, Next will give it a different random name.
- So, if we want to create a new file say `list.module.css` for a page, say `listDetails.js`, then simply import the `list.module.css` file in `listDetails.js` and using className attribute, we can apply that CSS in that page. So, just remember, the convention is to write like this: `name.module.css`
- NOTE: in `module.css` files we use class selectors and not element selectors. For ex: we can use `.btn` or `.title` and not `p` or `h1`.

### Not found page

- If a user goes to an endpoint that does not exist, we want to show a custom 404 page.
- In `pages` folder, we create a file called `404.js`. NOTE: Next does not create a route, `/404` for this. It just means that whenever a Use asks for an unknown endpoint, this page will be displayed.
- Inside this `404.js` file, write:

```js
import Link from "next/link";

const NotFound = () => {
  return (
    <div className="not-found">
      <h1>Ooops!</h1>
      <h2>Page not found...</h2>
      <p>
        Go back to
        <link href="/">
          <a>Homepage</a>
        </link>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default NotFound;
```

- So, we don't have to import this `404.js` file anywhere. Next, under the hood, takes care of it.So, if we go to any url or endpoint that does not exist, it will lead us to this 404 page we have just created.
